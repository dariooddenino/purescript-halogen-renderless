# Deprecated

This library is no longer maintained. Renderless components were a solution to reusable stateful logic in Halogen, but have since been replaced by Hooks, as described in [Introducing Halogen Hooks](https://thomashoneyman.com/articles/introducing-halogen-hooks).

**This library has been replaced by [purescript-halogen-hooks](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-hooks).**

[The previous releases](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-renderless/releases) will continue to work for older libraries that still depend on them.
